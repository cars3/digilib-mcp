# Agent instructions

Single home for everything an AI agent needs when working in, with, or on
digilib-mcp.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |

## How the root stays wired

The repository root carries thin pointers and symlinks so agent CLIs still
auto-discover these files after the move:

- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `KIMI.md`, `OPENCODE.md` at the root
  import or point at this folder.
- `.agents`, `.claude`, `.antigravitycli`, `.grok`, `.kimi`, `.opencode`, and
  `.qwen` at the root are symlinks to the matching directories here.

Edit files in this folder only. Never edit a root pointer or a skill symlink.
